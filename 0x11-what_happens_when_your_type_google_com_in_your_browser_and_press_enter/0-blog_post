When you type “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, several steps occur behind the scenes:

  *  DNS Request: The browser sends a Domain Name System (DNS) request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name “google.com” into an IP address. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with “google.com” (e.g., 172.217.168.206). Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed naming system that translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses. It acts as a phonebook for the internet, mapping domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. the DNS request is the initial step in the process of translating a domain name (like “google.com”) into its corresponding IP address. It involves checking the local DNS cache, contacting recursive DNS servers, iterative resolution, reaching the authoritative DNS server, caching the IP address, and returning it to the browser. This enables the browser to establish a connection with the correct server and retrieve the requested website.
  * TCP/IP: TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of network protocols that enables communication and data transmission across the internet. It provides a reliable, connection-oriented transmission mechanism for data packets. TCP/IP involves these steps: Connection Establishment: When you type “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, your browser initiates a TCP connection to the IP address obtained through the DNS resolution. This process involves a three-way handshake between the browser and the server. Segmentation: Data is broken down into smaller units called packets or segments. Each segment contains a portion of the data, along with additional TCP/IP headers. Packet Transmission: The segments are encapsulated into packets and transmitted over the internet. Each packet contains the source and destination IP addresses, port numbers, sequence numbers, and other control information. Reliable Delivery: TCP ensures reliable delivery of packets. It assigns a sequence number to each segment, tracks acknowledgments from the receiving end, and retransmits any lost or corrupted packets to ensure they are successfully received. Flow Control: TCP employs flow control mechanisms to manage the rate of data transmission. It prevents overwhelming the receiver by using techniques such as sliding window protocol, which regulates the number of unacknowledged segments allowed in flight. Connection Termination: Once the data transmission is complete, the TCP connection is terminated using a four-way handshake. This ensures that all the remaining data is received and acknowledged by both the sender and receiver before closing the connection.
  * Firewall: After the DNS request and before establishing a connection with the requested website, the connection passes through a firewall. The firewall, a network security system, plays a vital role in the process. It filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules, allowing or blocking packets based on criteria such as IP addresses, port numbers, and packet contents. It also detects and prevents unauthorized or malicious activities through intrusion detection and prevention techniques. Additionally, firewalls can perform network address translation (NAT), translating private IP addresses to a single public IP address for internet communication. They maintain logs of network traffic for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. By enforcing access control, detecting threats, and filtering network traffic, firewalls act as a crucial defense mechanism in network security.
  * HTTPS/SSL: When you type “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, the magic of HTTPS/SSL begins. It creates a secure connection between your browser and the web server hosting the website. Through an SSL handshake, cryptographic keys are exchanged, and the data transmitted between the browser and the server is encrypted, shielding it from prying eyes. The browser diligently verifies the server’s digital certificate to ensure its authenticity and legitimacy. With this secure foundation in place, all sensitive information you share, such as login credentials and personal details, is protected as it travels over the internet. HTTPS/SSL acts as an impenetrable shield, guaranteeing data integrity and confidentiality, providing peace of mind in an era where online security is paramount.
  * Load-Balancer: As you enter “google.com” in your browser, the load balancer takes the stage, orchestrating a symphony of incoming traffic. It diligently assesses the health and capacity of multiple servers, delicately balancing the workload. With its sophisticated load balancing algorithms, it navigates the intricate dance of distributing requests, ensuring optimal resource utilization and performance. In its pursuit of perfection, it seamlessly maintains session persistence, harmonizing each user’s experience across the server cluster. Scaling gracefully, it welcomes new servers into its ensemble, while gracefully recovering from the fall of unresponsive ones. The load balancer, a maestro of availability and scalability, ensures a flawless performance, as the web of requests and responses intertwine, creating an extraordinary symphony of seamless browsing.
  *     Web Server: Like a virtuoso conductor on the grand stage of the internet, the web server takes center stage when you visit “google.com”. With meticulous precision, it receives the baton from the load balancer and begins its performance. It gracefully handles the incoming request, extracting every nuance from its headers, URL, and attached data. Seamlessly, it retrieves the required resources, whether static files or dynamic content, breathing life into the web page. The web server orchestrates the symphony of connection management, deftly establishing and terminating network connections. Finally, it crafts a mesmerizing response, adorned with carefully constructed HTTP headers, and delivers it to your awaiting browser. The web server’s artistry lies in its ability to effortlessly harmonize the intricate dance of request processing, resource retrieval, content generation, and connection management, bringing the web experience to life with a symphony of digital excellence.
 *   Application Server: Behold the orchestrator of web application prowess, the application server, as it takes the center stage when you navigate to “google.com”. With seamless finesse, it receives the baton from the web server and embarks on a journey of request processing, transcending the boundaries of mere data. With its mastery of business logic execution, it weaves together a tapestry of database interactions, complex calculations, and rules to fulfill your every command. A virtuoso of data access and integration, it harmonizes disparate systems, seamlessly retrieving and updating data to fuel the application’s operation. With a deft touch, it manages the symphony of user sessions, conducting the creation, expiration, and persistence of session data. Finally, it dazzles with a crescendo of response generation, crafting dynamic responses that captivate your browser’s attention. The application server’s artistry lies in its ability to seamlessly integrate disparate components, perform complex computations, and deliver dynamic responses, resulting in an enchanting user experience that leaves you spellbound.
 *   Database: Behold the magnificent realm where data finds its eternal abode — the database. Like an architectural marvel, it stands as the guardian of structured information, meticulously organizing and safeguarding its treasures. Within its hallowed chambers, data finds solace, arranged in tables, columns, and rows, forming a tapestry of knowledge. With a flicker of a query, it reveals its secrets, retrieving the desired nuggets of wisdom with unparalleled precision. A master of manipulation, it gracefully accepts the application’s commands, seamlessly adding, modifying, or removing records to mold the data’s destiny. Unyielding in its pursuit of integrity, it enforces rules and constraints, ensuring that the data remains pure and untainted. As the application’s audience grows, the database flexes its prowess, effortlessly scaling to accommodate ever-increasing demands, while delivering performances that rival even the most magnificent symphonies. It guards its gates with utmost vigilance, fortifying data security with robust authentication and access controls. The database stands as a testament to the power of data, offering reliability, scalability, and security, cementing its role as the bedrock of web application excellence.

In summary, from the moment you enter “google.com” in your browser and press Enter, a remarkable journey begins.
