# What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

* When you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter, several steps occur behind the scenes:

  1.  DNS Request: The browser sends a Domain Name System (DNS) request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name "google.com" into an IP address. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with "google.com" (e.g., 172.217.168.206).

  2.  TCP/IP: The browser establishes a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection with the IP address obtained from the DNS server. TCP/IP ensures reliable communication between the browser and the server.

  3.  Firewall: The connection passes through any firewalls or network security systems that may be in place. Firewalls protect against unauthorized access and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.

  4.  HTTPS/SSL: If the website uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), the browser initiates a secure connection using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption ensures that the data transmitted between the browser and the server remains confidential and secure.

  5.   Load-Balancer: In the case of a high-traffic website like Google, multiple servers may be used behind a load balancer. The load balancer distributes incoming requests across these servers to ensure efficient handling of traffic and prevent overloading of any specific server.

  6.  Web Server: The request reaches the web server, such as Apache or Nginx, which handles the HTTP request. The web server processes the request and generates an appropriate response, usually in the form of an HTML page.

  7.  Application Server: In more complex applications, the web server may communicate with an application server. The application server runs the backend code (e.g., PHP, Python, Java) and performs additional processing based on the request, such as retrieving data from a database.

  8.  Database: If necessary, the application server interacts with a database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, to fetch or store data. This step is common when dynamic content or user-specific information needs to be retrieved or updated.

  9.  Response: The web server or application server generates a response, which typically includes an HTML page, and sends it back to the browser through the established TCP/IP connection.

  10.  Rendering: The browser receives the response and renders the HTML page, displaying the content, images, and any other resources included in the page.

Through these steps, typing "google.com" and pressing Enter initiates a series of interactions involving DNS resolution, network protocols, security measures, server infrastructure, and data processing, ultimately delivering the requested webpage to your browser.
